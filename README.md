# cryptoKnight
Project 3 - A cryptocurrency portfolio tracking application (WiP - needs refactoring)

# The Brief

## Shares App

A local trader has come to you with a portfolio of shares. She wants to be able to analyse it more effectively. She has a small sample data set to give you and would like you to build a minimal viable product (MVP) that uses the data to display her portfolio in useful ways so that she can make better decisions.

## MVP

 - View total current value
 - View individual and total performance trends
 - Retrieve a list of share prices from an external API and allow the user to add shares to her portfolio
 - Provide a chart of the current values in her portfolio

## Examples of further features

Speculation based on trends and further financial modelling.

  - Based on the last 6 weeks of data, (e.g. it reduced by 5%) predict the performance of a stock for the next 6 weeks. Based on that what would be the sum of the total on a certain day in the future.

  - She wants to know what would happen to the value of her portfolio if the price of a share changed by 10% or if she reduced her quantity by 15%.
  - What price does a stock have to get to in order to meet her investment target?
  - To get her Â£1700 worth of RBS shares what price does it have to go to?
  - Buy new shares
  - Sell shares
